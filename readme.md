### its_live web portal tutorial
The main purpose of this tutorial is to show how to use NASA's
[its_live web portal](https://nsidc.org/apps/itslive/) to download image pair velocities.

Many other tutorials exist that are great. For example Emma Marshal's [Using xarray to examine cloud-based glacier surface velocity data](https://e-marshall.github.io/itslive/intro.html). In the future make a tutorial using Emma's  [itslivetools](https://github.com/e-marshall/itslivetools) for Greenland specific data.
